# AI-ML: "Scientific AI" Workload

## Purpose and Description

The purpose of this benchmark is to capture a 'typical scientific AI' workload performed by researchers at NREL. There will be both 'single node' and 'multi node' components for the benchmark, using PyTorch as the AI/ML framework.

The exact model is TBD and is being actively developed.

## Licensing Requirements

None.

## Other Requirements

On Kestrel, a custom implementation of NCCL that is built with CXI-enabled libfabric is required to scale calculations beyond a single GPU node. See [the GPU-GPU communication microbenchmark README](../microbenchmark/README.md) for more information.

## How to build

This is an ongoing effort, and more details will be released here in the near future.
