# HPL

## Purpose and Description
HPL solves a random dense linear system in double precision arithmetic on distributed-memory. It depends on the Message Passing Interface, Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, or the Vector Signal Image Processing Library. The software is available at the [Netlib HPL benchmark](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/) and most vendors including ([Nvidia](https://docs.nvidia.com/nvidia-hpc-benchmarks/HPL_benchmark.html), [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/zen-software-studio/applications/pre-built-applications/zen-hpl.html), and [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-guide-windows/2023-2/intel-distribution-for-linpack-benchmark-contents.html) offer hardware-optimized versions of it. The HPL benchmark assesses both the peak performance and the integrity of the system's hardware, from individual nodes to the entire system.
