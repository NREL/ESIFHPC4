# AMR-Wind

## Purpose and Description

AMR-Wind is a massively parallel, block-structured adaptive-mesh, incompressible flow solver for wind turbine and wind farm simulations. It depends on the AMReX library that provides mesh data structures, mesh adaptivity, and linear solvers to handle its governing equations. This software is part the exawind ecosystem, is available [here](https://github.com/exawind/AMR-Wind). The AMR-Wind benchmark assesses system throughput under stress, and how latency affects application performance on GPU-accelerated nodes.
