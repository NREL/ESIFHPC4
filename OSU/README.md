# OSU Microbenchmarks

## Purpose and Description
The OSU Microbenchmark collection represents a suite of tests used to measure MPI performance in distributed computing systems. The tests include examples such as checking latency (ping-pong), measuring bandwidth rates across pairs of processes, collective tests, and other device based tests. The benchmarks are written in three different programming languages: C, Java, and Python. We use these tests to measure the performance of MPI functions on NREL HPC systems. The primary tests used are: latency, multi-bandwidth/multi-rate, all-to-all, and all-reduce.
